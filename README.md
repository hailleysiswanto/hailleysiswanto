★ Hi! My name is Hailley, and I am a Junior at Yale University studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science ★

★ Right now I am super interested in the intersection of engineering, cs, and medicine ★

★ My most recent experiences in cs are the quantum computing and systems programming classes I am in right now ★

★ I am on GitHub because I want to fully immerse myself in bigger projects, learn a lot, and contribute even more ★
