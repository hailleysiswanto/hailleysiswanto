★ Hi! My name is Hailley, and I am a second-year at Yale University studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science ★

★ Right now I am super interested in the intersection of engineering, cs, and economics ★

★ My most recent experience in cs is the data structures class I'm currently taking (a lot of work but super fun) ★

★ I am on GitHub because I want to fully immerse myself in bigger projects, learn a lot, and contribute even more ★

★ email: hailley.siswanto@yale.edu ★
